      <h2>A History of Predictive Animals</h2>
      <p>In a data-driven era obsessed with statistical modeling and predictive analytics, we often forget the role that animal oracles have played throughout human history. </p>

      <p>Since nearly <a href="http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199589425.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199589425-e-019">the begining of recorded history,</a> humans have sought ways to use animals in dinivation practices in order to gain a better understanding of the natural world around them. </p>

      <p>However, the emergence of Punxsutawney Phil in 1887 can be seen as the start of the modern trend of locally famous animals making predictions regarding upcoming events. According to the <a href="http://www.groundhog.org/inner-circle">inner circle of the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club,</a> Punxsutawney Phil has been making annual predictions ever since, consuming a magic elixir each year that has allowed him to live for over 130 years. Each year, Phil determines whether or not Spring will be arriving early. Similar traditions have followed across the country, substituting in locally-appropriate animals, such as Pierre C. Shadeaux, a nutria that makes a similar prediction each year in Louisinana.</p>

      <p>Yet, not all predictive animals spring from local tradition. <a href="http://mentalfloss.com/article/81063/story-lady-wonder-psychic-horse">Lady Wonder</a> was a supposedly psychic horse active from the late 1920s through the early 1950s, trained by her owner to operate a large manual keyboard-like device in order to guess or make predictions about any number of things. Thousands of people paid money to see Lady Wonder's psychic abilities in action. In 1952, Massachusetts police consulted with Lady Wonder, who successfully provided them with the location of the body of a missing boy. </p>

      <p>Much more recently, <a href="https://www.crossroadshospice.com/hospice-palliative-care-blog/2016/april/11/meet-oscar-the-cat-that-predicts-death-and-provides-comfort/">a therapy cat named Oscar</a> that resides at a hospice in Providence, RI has received attention in the New England Journal of Medicine for visiting patients shortly before they pass away. To date, Oscar is estimated to have predicted over 100 deaths in the last decade.<p>

      <p>Today, animal oracles most commonly appear every four years to predict World Cup match outcomes.</p>
